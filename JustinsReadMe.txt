Focus: 

1. Loose coupling/ Seperation of Concerns
	Seperating 
		Data access 
		from Buisness rules
		from xxx 

2. Unit of Work. 
	All actions performed on DB must be grouped as one. 

[WIP]
3. SOLID Principles. 

	Single Resp. 
		All functions, methods, class's and project server 1 and only 1 function. 

	Open Close.
		Extend class behaviour with out modifying it. 

	Lispokv... 

	Interface.
		Loosly couple the conctrete logic of how things are done to 1 place. 
		make fined grained. should not need to implement an interface it doesnt need to use. 

	Depencency Injection.
		Big box. Take objects out of box to use as need be. Define life time. Share resources. Control as and when need to maintain.
		Depend on abstractions no cocretions

With SOLID get: reusable, maintainable, scalable, testable
